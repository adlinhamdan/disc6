		<p>Hello there! I am an international student from Malaysia, and this is my second year living in the United States. I love food, and coming from a multi-racial country, the States offer a vast array of foods to try that I cannot find in my home country. I'm taking my chance being here to expand my cuisine experience so I can give recommendations to my friends and family when they travel. I love exploring different places, so I travel a lot too. Hope you are ready for an adventure!</p>
		<p>Visit my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ladylind4?igsh=Y2U3MDZoMWo1Z2xy&utm_source=qr">Instagram page</a> for more food reviews!</p>

		<p>Here are some places I would recommend, and I will be reviewing what food I had while I was at these places:</p>

			<dt><b>Madison, Wisconsin</b></dt>
			<dd>Ah! The capital city of Wisconsin. Probably my second home since I am going to school here. I spend my free time exploring different kinds of cuisines offered here. From Italian fine dining to quick Chinese takeout, I would never get sick of the food here.</dd>
			
			<dt><b>Portland, Oregon</b></dt>
			<dd>One of my favorite places in the Pacific Northwest region. The nature is beyond beautiful, and the weather is just nice, especially in the summer. Spoiler alert: you may find weird people, but they are <i>good</i> weird people. The last time I went here was summer 2023, but Portland, you still have my heart.</dd>
			
			<dt><b>Seattle, Washington</b></dt>
			<dd>Another state in the Pacific Northwest you should visit! The state parks nearby are breathtaking, and itâ€™s one of the gems in the States. But if you prefer the hustle and bustle of city life, Seattle is the perfect place! There are many cuisines you can find here, and I would recommend taking a lot of walks to appreciate the skyline view.</dd>
